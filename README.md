# final-project

This is a project for weather nerds. Whenever there's severe weather on the forecast, I'm usually flitting between staring at the weather radar and staring at the sky. My vision for this site is for people to be able to post live descriptions (and eventually photos) of specific weather events happening in a specific time and a specific place.

I have a backend built with node that incorporates GET, POST, PATCH, AND DELETE requests and connects to a MongoDB database. Each one of these works and has been tested in insomnia. I have a front end built in React that uses an API from https://www.mapbox.com/ that renders a map with which I can interact. 

I've had a few issues with the fetches that have made connecting between the frontend and backend inconsistent, but the plan will be to have these fully up and running, enabling the user to click on the map and post details in a pop-out box. One of my favourite sites to go to is https://www.lightningmaps.org/ and I wanted to emulate the visual simplicity of that. 

I've never been one for flashy webpages when seeking out weather information and my suspition is that any other weather nerd would feel the same way.
